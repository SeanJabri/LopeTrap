# LopeTrap Social Engineering Campaign

## Who are we?

LopeTrap is the name of a social engineering campaign conducted by a group of IT and Cybersecurity students at GCU. This initiative targets the campus's students, staff, and faculty. LopeTrap employed OSINT for reconnaissance and analyzed campus trends to design our attacks. Working closely with IT Security, we obtained approval and conducted two rounds of social engineering campaigns against the GCU campus. After the attacks, we actively participated in the remediation process to address the uncovered vulnerabilities.

## Mission:
Our mission is to conduct tests on the GCU campus, including its students, staff, and faculty, to evaluate their susceptibility to social engineering attacks and tactics. Following this assessment, we plan to educate them and provide remediation strategies, whether through policy enhancements, procedural adjustments, or increased awareness among individuals.

## Vision:
Our vision for this project is to cultivate a stronger cybersecurity-oriented mindset among the students, staff, and faculty of the GCU campus. By promoting awareness, knowledge, and proactive measures against cyber threats, we aim to empower individuals to safeguard their digital assets and contribute to a campus environment that prioritizes security.
